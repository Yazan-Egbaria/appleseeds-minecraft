# Minecraft

## Game Steps

1. **Game Design:**

At first, I will do the UI, the main menu page (which is the first page), and then the world page (which is the second page)

* Main Menu Page:
  1. Background wallpaper
  2. Minecraft Logo
  3. Button to start the game

* World Page
  1. At the very beginning, the whole page should be made out of a sky texture
  2. Implement rocks and dirt and trees
  3. Implement the tools sidebar (Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel)

2. **Game Features:**

* Clicking on a tool should pick the tool, clicking on the same tool again should place it back in the inventory

* Clicking on a tile while holding a tool will remove the tile (related to a specified tool, e.g. 
  1. Axe - for cutting trees
  2. Pickaxe - for mining rocks
  3. Shovel - for grass and digging dirt

* A counter for tiles got removed

* Clicking on a tile in the inventory and then clicking somewhere in the world should place down tile elements

* Reset button, it will reset the world to how it started
